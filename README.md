# hello-world
Hello github!

I'm Mackey. 
My hobbies are jogging, camera and guitar. 
(I'm still practicing the guitar and I can't play the song ...)

I am a project manager in the information system department of an electrical equipment company, 
designing and developing apps for core business systems.
